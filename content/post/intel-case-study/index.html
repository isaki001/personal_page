I used oneAPI to increase the portability capabilities of my integrators. I originally implemented PAGANI and m-Cubes in CUDA, which allows users to utilize
NVIDIA GPUs to integrate multi-dimensional integrals. With oneAPI I was able to expand the list of compatible hardware and I demonstrated that you can achieve the same 
performance with CUDA with no more than 15% performance penalty.
